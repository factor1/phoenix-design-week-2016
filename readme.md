# Phoenix Design Week
Every year, Phoenix Design Week brings together hundreds of creative professionals
and students from across the Valley for a week-long celebration of designâ€”a series
of presentations, workshops and events, all curated to inspire and strengthen the
Phoenix design community.

The highlight of Phoenix Design Week is the Method and Madness Conference, a
two-day conference organized by community volunteers that features world-class
speakers and local experts imparting actionable insights, hands-on education and
a fiery passion for their craft.
